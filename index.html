        <h4>Who We Are / Brief History:</h4>
        
        <a id="homeBody"><p>New Deal Image-Liberia is a non-profit organization located in the Republic of Liberia and is represented in the United States. The founder and international coordinator of New Deal Image-Liberia Paul F. Yarwaye, who presently resides in the United States, having suffered and experienced the consequences of unsafe drinking water and the shortages of basic foods, decided to establish New Deal Image-Liberia for intervention into the situation. The organization was founded in 218 to operate in the Republic of Liberia in the sectors of safe drinking water supply, agriculture works (food crop production). New Deal image has been registered, accredited, and certificated by the government of Liberia. Furthermore, Liberia is a West African country that is condensed with underprivileged communities of which River Cess County and its environs formed a part. The mission of New Deal Image-Liberia is to gear-up efforts in improving the ill-health (unsafe drinking water and scarcity of food) and livelihoods (community development) of the people to a minimum, if not eradicated; especially women and children by providing clean and safe drinking water, progressive agriculture road map to nutrition, entrepreneurship, and eventually sanitation facilities, thus sustainability. On top of that, given the magnitude of the Liberian economic crisis, New Deal Image—Liberia (NEWDIL) was formed to put River Cess County and Liberia on the path of poverty reduction, especially the socially marginalized people of River Cess Community inhabitants. Sometimes those rural community inhabitants in object poverty are forgotten by the rest of the people. Contrarily, <strong>“Walk Together”</strong> is an avenue to counter-balance isolation of the community residence living in poverty and demonstrate that someone cares. 
</p>
<p>
Preferentially, the organization got its name by adoption from the former New York Governor, Frankly D. Roosevelt. <strong>“The New Deal”</strong> was the name of President Franklyn D. Roosevelt’s vision for America. <em>Western World History: The Human Experience</em> (1999) by Mounir A. Farah et al. reveals that during the nation’s presidential election campaign of 1932, Roosevelt campaigned on the promise of “a new deal” for the American people. His conviction was that the Federal Government had to aid the economic downturns and provide relief for the unemployed. When Roosevelt assumed state power, he used his first 100-day administration to send a number of bills to Congress that immediately became laws. The measures regulated the banks and stock market, and established guidelines for industry and agriculture. His administration restored people to work when he established public-works projects to build roads, dams, bridges, homes, and parks. Later, New Deal regulations provided for social security and unemployment insurance. Though his New deal policies did not entirely nor successfully end the Great depression, they help restored the confidence of the nation.

<p>
<strong>New Deal Image – Liberia, Inc.</strong> is a reflective image of Roosevelt’s new deal vision cast in River Cess County – Liberia, West Africa for improved economic development, thereby breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Our Mission is to walk with social marginalized people of Liberia and its environs and promote sustainable community development programs. We intend to build rural communities by fostering relationships of mutual understanding and support that are culturally diverse, empowering and without prejudice.</p>
